# Analysing Irish Political Party Manifestos with NLP

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Irish political party manifestos. The analysis includes data exploration, corpus preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and keyness analysis. Key tasks include:

- Creating a dictionary of housing-related terms.
- Tokenizing and processing text data to extract insights.
- Applying sentiment analysis using the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary.
- Performing linear regression to predict sentiment scores.
- Conducting keyness analysis to compare word usage between political groups.

The project uses R and leverages libraries such as `quanteda`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2` for text analysis and visualization. The results provide insights into housing mentions, sentiment trends, and linguistic differences across party manifestos.
